            <h2>Responding to "The Romanticized Ceiling": Why Data Still Needs Human Judgment</h2>
            <p class="date">January 26, 2026</p>

            <p>Reading <a href="https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/plate-composition-blog/the-romanticized-ceiling.html">"The Romanticized Ceiling,"</a> I found myself agreeing with much of its central argument[cite: 341]. The essay makes a compelling case against the romanticization of “intangibles” like faith, heart, or the so-called "it factor," especially when these ideas are used to override statistical evidence[cite: 342].</p>

            <p>History has shown that relying too heavily on gut feelings often leads to bias, exclusion, and poor decision-making[cite: 343]. Data and increasingly AI-driven analysis have helped correct many of those errors by offering more consistent, objective evaluations[cite: 344]. In most cases, I agree that numbers deserve our trust[cite: 345]. Data does not have favorites, it does not get tired, emotional, or influenced by stereotypes[cite: 346].</p>

            <p>However, while I agree that romanticized narratives should not replace evidence, I do not believe data alone is sufficient to fully evaluate human potential[cite: 349]. The issue is not that numbers are wrong, but that they are incomplete[cite: 350]. Much of Dr. Plate’s argument focuses on performance consistency and convincingly shows that traits like being “clutch” are often the result of variance rather than stable, internal qualities[cite: 351].</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Rejecting romantic myths does not require rejecting the value of informed human observation altogether." [cite: 353]
            </blockquote>

            <p>Consider the example of recruiting an athlete. A team that relies exclusively on data might select a player whose statistics perfectly match the team’s needs[cite: 354]. But what happens if a coach notices a technical flaw—like poor footwork—that can be corrected?[cite: 355, 356]. With proper coaching, that player could surpass others whose numbers initially looked stronger[cite: 357]. If the decision were based solely on data, that potential would remain invisible[cite: 358].</p>

            <p>Ultimately, I do not see data and human judgment as opposing forces; I see them as complementary[cite: 371]. Data should guide decisions and protect us from bias, while human observation should question anomalies and identify areas where growth is possible[cite: 372]. It is a world where numbers lead, and human insight follows carefully behind, aware of its limits but still valuable[cite: 376].</p>
