            <h2>The Dependency Trap: Why AI Should Be Your Compass, Not Your Pilot</h2>
            <p class="date">February 23, 2026</p>

            <p>In his recent post, <a href="https://zayamaro211.github.io/star-birds-strategy.html">"Star Birds and the Strategy of Faith,"</a> Zay Amaro uses a resource-management game to illustrate a profound truth: AI can give us the "dictionary" of recipes, but it cannot give us the courage to explore or the wisdom to choose. I strongly agree with Zay’s perspective. AI is a brilliant tool for understanding, but the moment it stops being a "dictionary" and starts being the "player," we lose everything that makes the effort worthwhile.</p>

            <h3>The Illusion of Progress</h3>
            <p>We often confuse efficiency with growth. I agree with using the "dictionary" because it helps us learn and bridge gaps in our knowledge. Like the drawing techniques discussed by Dr. Plate, a dictionary is a tool to help you comprehend and improve. But if the AI does the thinking for you, where is your contribution?</p>

            <p>If you don't put anything of your part to comprehend the "why" behind a solution, your actual experience in that area remains null. You aren't evolving; you are just watching a machine succeed in your name. To grow, you must understand the mechanics of the game you are playing.</p>

            <h3>What Happens When the Lights Go Out?</h3>
            <p>This leads us to a critical question of autonomy. Think about this: If the AI plays for you today, how will you play tomorrow if the AI is gone? If the "AI" disappears tomorrow, you would have to start from the very beginning. You would be back at square one because you never actually learned to play the game; you only learned to follow instructions.</p>

            <p>The danger lies in how we use the tool. If I use a dictionary to learn a new language, I am becoming a polyglot. If I use a translation bot to speak for me, I am still monolingual. One creates a permanent change in my brain; the other only creates a temporary output on a screen.</p>

            <p>When we use AI as a dictionary, we are using it to clarify concepts and accelerate our learning. This ensures that if the technology fails, the knowledge stays with us. We wouldn't have to start over because the "performance" wasn't just in the machine—it was in our own understanding.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Reclaiming the Controller</h3>
            <p>Zay’s review of <em>Star Birds</em> reminds us that the fun—and the growth—is in the exploration. If we let the AI live for us, we might reach the "high score," but we will be strangers to our own achievements.</p>

            <p>We must protect our ability to function independently. Leverage the "dictionary" to understand the world better, but never let it take the controller out of your hands. At the end of the day, growth isn't about the destination you reached; it's about the skills you kept when the machine was turned off.</p>
