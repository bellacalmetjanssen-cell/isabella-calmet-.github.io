            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my digital portfolio for <strong>ENGL 170</strong>. My name is Isabella Calmet, 
                and I am a student dedicated to exploring the intersections of language, rhetoric, and 
                contemporary literature.
            </p>

                [Place for your personal bio: You can talk about your major, your academic interests, 
                and what you hope to achieve through this course. Mentioning your specific writing style 
                or a favorite author is always a nice touch for a literature-focused blog.]

            <h3>Course Goals</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout this semester in ENGL 170, I aim to refine my critical thinking skills and 
                develop a more nuanced approach to academic writing. This blog serves as a space to 
                document my progress, share weekly reflections, and engage with the course materials 
                in a meaningful way.
