            <p>
                Hello! My name is Isabella Calmet. I’m a student in ENGL 170 exploring writing, technology, and the ways AI intersects with creativity. This is a brief placeholder bio, which I can customize later to include more about my background, interests, and goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy reading, writing, and experimenting with new ways to communicate ideas online. Stay tuned for updates, insights, and reflections from my journey in this course!
